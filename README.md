# Implementation-of-Multiple-Linear-Regression-Model-with-Cross-Validation-for-Predicting-Car-Prices

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of cars using a multiple linear regression model and evaluate the model performance using cross-validation.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm-

Import Libraries: Bring in the necessary libraries.

2.Load the Dataset: Load the dataset into your environment.

3.Data Preprocessing: Handle any missing data and encode categorical variables as needed.

4.Define Features and Target: Split the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).

5.Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

6.Build Multiple Linear Regression Model: Initialize and create a multiple linear regression model.

7.Train the Model: Fit the model to the training data.

8.Evaluate Performance: Assess the model's performance using cross-validation.

9.Display Model Parameters: Output the model’s coefficients and intercept.

10.Make Predictions & Compare: Predict outcomes and compare them to the actual values.
